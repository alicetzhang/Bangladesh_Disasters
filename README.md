## Final Project - Natural Disasters in Bangladesh
#### Alice Tianbo Zhang (tz2218@columbia.edu)


##### Description
In this project, I investigate Bangladesh's exposure to natural disasters using historical geo-referenced data on disaster frequency and intensity. I focus specifically on earthquakes and hurricanes because of their readily available location information. 


##### Table of Contents
- Part I - Earthquake and Topography Maps in GMT
    >* Extract DEM and earthquake data from GeoMapApp and create maps in GMT.
- Part II - Earthquake Hazard Maps
    >* Compare and complement earthquake data extracted from GeoMapApp with data on earthquake hazard from GSHAP.
- Part III - Historical Earthquake Occurrence 1900-2017
    >* Analyze the spatial and temporal variation of historical earthquake occurrence in Bangladesh.
- Part IV - Correlation between Earthquake PGA and Magnitude
    >* Investigate the question "to what extent do PGA values predict the actual magnitude of earthquakes"?
- Part V - Historical Hurricane Tracks 1848 - 2017
    >* Use `Basemap` to visualize storm track location and wind speed data for Bangladesh.
